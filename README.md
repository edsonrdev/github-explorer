## 🚀 About the project

GitHub Explorer is a web application that allows the user to explore/search basic information about GitHub profiles and repositories.

Through a form, the user informs the name of the profile and sends a request to the GitHub API, which returns this data to our front-end React.

It is a simple application, but developed using important React concepts (states, props and components) and used Styled-Components for visual styling.

I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed implementing it.
